![](flight.gif)

Flights are constantly taking off and landing around the world, and monitoring them can be quite challenging. Introducing Flight Radar, an incredibly useful web application developed for real-time flight tracking.

🌐 Real-Time Flight Count

In the header section, you'll find the current number of flights provided by the API. This feature gives you a quick overview of the ongoing air traffic.

🗺️ Map and List Views

Users have the option to switch between map and list views on the main page. By default, the map view is selected, providing users with a tailored experience based on their preferences.

✈️ Detailed Flight Information

Aircraft in the air are marked with airplane icons on the map. Clicking on these icons opens a window with options for "details" and "clear route." Selecting "details" will display comprehensive flight information retrieved from the API in a window on the left side of the screen. This allows users to gather more insights about their desired flight.

📋 User-Friendly List View

The list section maintains an active "details" button for each flight entry. Additionally, a pagination structure at the bottom ensures easy navigation through the list of flights.

🛠️ Used Libraries
